<h1>Simple Project to understand the power of flexbox</h1>
<p>Before the Flexbox Layout module, there were four layout modes:
  <ul>
    <li>Block, for sections in a webpage</li>
    <li>Inline, for text</li>
    <li>Table, for two-dimensional table data</li>
    <li>Positioned, for explicit position of an element</li>
    
</ul>
The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.</p>
